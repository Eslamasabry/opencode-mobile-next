# oc_app handoff

Last updated: 2026-08-25 (Asia/Dubai)

## Current GitHub APK

- Branch: `master`
- App version: `1.0.15+16`
- Git tag: `v1.0.15+16`
- APK: <https://github.com/Eslamasabry/oc_app/releases/download/v1.0.15%2B16/app-release.apk>
- APK SHA-256: `dd9a1be5f038626713e65d45d50232b283226e6704bc797dd92a98d8f2e91a95`
- Shorebird status: built with Shorebird Flutter `3.47.1`, but no `1.0.15+16` Shorebird release was published

The version was advanced so the existing `1.0.14+15` OTA patches cannot replace the overhauled model selector and chat composer. The APK was installed on the Android simulator, restarted twice, and confirmed to retain the new selector. Flutter analysis was clean and all 183 tests passed.

## Previous Shorebird baseline

- Implementation commit: `4b17f40` (`Enforce reliable local Termux model`)
- App version: `1.0.14+15`
- Shorebird release ID: `787919`
- Shorebird Stable Patch 1: `615599`
- Shorebird Stable Patch 2: `615694`
- Baseline APK: <https://github.com/Eslamasabry/oc_app/releases/download/v1.0.14%2B15/app-release.apk>

Patch 2 remains the current fix for `1.0.14+15`. An installed `1.0.14+15` downloads it on launch and activates it on the following full restart. Native Android changes still require a new APK.

## Chat issue and fix

The apparent endless `thinking` state was caused by intermittent upstream 503 responses and long server retries from `opencode/big-pickle`; Flutter SSE itself was working.

Patch 1 migrated only automatically chosen `big-pickle` preferences. It mistakenly preserved an explicitly selected legacy model, which could leave a user's phone on the failing provider.

Patch 2 forces the managed local Termux profile (`http://127.0.0.1:4096`) back to `opencode/nemotron-3.5-lightning-free` whenever its catalog loads, including when `big-pickle` had been explicitly persisted. Remote profiles are not changed.

## Verified evidence

- Started from the exact bad persisted state: explicit `opencode|big-pickle`.
- Confirmed the original APK launched Shorebird Patch 2 from `patches/2/dlc.vmcode`.
- Confirmed the persisted model became `opencode|nemotron-3.5-lightning-free` and its explicit marker became false.
- Started the real Termux/OpenCode `1.18.21` server on `127.0.0.1:4096`.
- Sent `hello` through the Android UI and observed `Hello! How can I help you today?`.
- Flutter analysis: clean.
- Flutter tests: all 181 passed.
- Release-script safety test: passed.

## Continuation checks

```bash
git status --short --branch
git log -3 --oneline --decorate
/home/eslam/.config/shorebird/bin/shorebird patches list --release-version=1.0.14+15
adb devices -l
```

Do not print or copy persisted server passwords from Android preferences, process arguments, or Termux diagnostics into chat or logs.

## Conversation note

The user later clarified that “this chat keeps crashing” referred to the long Codex conversation, not the Android chat screen. This handoff exists to allow a fresh conversation without losing the release context above.
